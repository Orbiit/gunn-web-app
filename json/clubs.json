    "desc": "The Sports Journalism Club primarily aims to raise enthusiasm about Gunn sports teams through the use of sports journalism. Parents and teachers in Gunn Sports Boosters have, for many years, raised funds for many of the sports teams through planning events and selling concessions. After working with them to design their new website, I saw an opportunity for Gunn students to become involved as well. Providing coverage of the upcoming games, recent game outcomes, athlete profiles, and more on the Sports Boosters website will ultimately have more people attending games and being enthusiastic about our sports teams. In addition, adding this coverage to the Gunn Sports Boosters website will enhance it and potentially bring in more donations. By starting this club, I am hoping to involve students in this form of sports journalism and have them contribute to the website. The club will not involve any field trips and will cover only home games. Ultimately, the Gunn Sports Journalism Club provides two things. First, for students in the club to have fun and gain experience in covering the sports teams (beyond what is already done in the Oracle). Second, for readers of the Gunn Sports Boosters website to become more enthusiastic about sports in our community.",
