  UGWA now has the proper alternate schedule on the first day of school, in
  addition to a few other changes.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Wednesday SELF has been replaced with Gunn Together, where you meet with
    your teachers from Periods 1 through 7 (they cycle through each period every
    week). Currently, the first week's Gunn Together is with Period 5, then the
    second week and onwards cycles starting from Period 1, but I might have
    guessed wrong.
  </li>
  <li>
    SELF has taken over the school, so the option to hide SELF has been removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Period 8 has been added to the schedule. You can hide it in the Options.
    Editing period H times has been removed.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Side note: It's possible the school no longer uses their Google Calendar to
  post alternate schedules ;-;.
