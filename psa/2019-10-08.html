<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>Some users use UGWA only briefly to check the schedule; the PSAs get in the way of this, so they instinctively find
    and click close. There's no reason to force users to read something they don't care about, so announcements are now
    listed in the Options tab instead.</p>
<ul>
    <li>New announcements system</li>
    <li>The end time for the entire day is now also at the top</li>
</ul>
